      <h2> History of Jazz </h2>
        <p style="text-align:left;margin-left: 40px;">Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as 'America's classical music'. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. </p>

        <u>Today's Jazz</u>
          <p> Today’s jazz artists are basically going in one of three directions: traditional, contemporary mainstream, or "anything goes."</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Traditionalists are performing jazz mainly patterned on Blues, Swing, Bebop, and Hard Bop; in other words, they exclude Free Jazz and Fusion
              <li>
                <ol class="b"
                  <li>Traditionalists believe that what they play is "real jazz," not the various hybrids and "add-ons" (according to them) that occurred in the 1960s and since. They are also known as "jazz purists."
                  </li>
                  <li>Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis is at the forefront of this movement. He is an internationally acclaimed musician and has played a major role in the resurgence of jazz.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              <li>Contemporary mainstream jazz artists are influenced mostly by Hard Bop sensibilities.
              </li>
                <ol class="b">
                  <li>Contemporary mainstream jazz artists use, for the most part, Hard Bop instrumentation and musical forms.</li>
                  <li>owever, within the Hard Bop framework, contemporary mainstream jazz artists continue to push the music forward, e.g., ever increasing technical proficiency on their instruments, expanded musical harmonies (more difficult and complex chords and chord progressions), and deeper and varied emotions expressed.</li>
                  <li>Trumpeter Terence Blanchard is one of today’s most important contemporary mainstream jazz artists.</li>
                </ol>
              <li>“Anything goes” jazz artists will put all kinds of music into the pot and stir it up; these can include but are not limited to: all styles of jazz
              </li> 
                <ol class="b">
                  <li>all styles of jazz</li>
                  <li>classical music (mostly of the 20th and 21st century variety)</li>
